# Deploying applications locally on minikube:
If you are a developer (or even a system administrator), and you want to experiment with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), then [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is something you should really look into. It is a simple single-node kubernetes cluster, which installs easy on your work computer - as a small virtual machine. It is open-source, and is free of cost. It is especially useful, when you want to learn / work with Kubernetes, but can't afford to run even a small Kubernetes cluster in a cloud environment, such as GCP, etc. 

The emphasis is on having minikube *running as a VM*, (not as a process on docker), because this takes away all the possible complexity away from your local computer. It (minikube VM) makes setting up and running the kubernetes cluster very easy. 

## What do you need to get it to work?
You need decently powered computer, with following specs:
* CPUs with hardware virtualization (Intel VT or AMD-V). Normally Intel's i3, i5, i7 (and now i9), and AMD's FX 63xx, 83xx, 9xxx, A10, A8, etc  are a good choices. 
* Minimum 4 GB RAM is good enough if you want to run Linux. Minikube takes 2 GB RAM from host computer, and assigns it to the minikube VM. If you are using Windows, then you need more, because windows is basically bloatware, and it just abuses RAM. 
* At least 20 GB free disk-space on your host OS, because minikube will create a 20 GB virtual disk. You can increase the size of the virtual disk at the time of minikube setup.
* A Hypervisor running on the computer, such as KVM. I don't recommend VirtualBox, or HyperV, or anything else. However, if you are on Windows or Mac, then you have no choice but to use one of these.
* Chromebooks will not work.

## Install and Setup Minikube on your local computer:
Lets install minikube on our system. The computer I am using is an Intel i7, 16 GB RAM, runs Fedora Linux 31, and runs KVM as Hypervisor. Just so you know, KVM is world's strongest, most efficient and most lightweight Hypervisor. It runs directly inside the Linux kernel - as a loadable kernel module. RedHat (world's largest open source company) uses KVM in the heart of it's **RedHat Enterprise Virtualization** product. AWS (the biggest cloud provider) is also moving it's infrastructure from XEN to KVM.

**Note:** This document was written for a computer, which has Fedora Linux as Host OS and KVM as Hypervisor. If you have a different OS or Hypervisor on your computer, then you need to consult a different guide for installing minikube on your computer.
 
### Prerequisites:
Besides OS and Hypervisor, you also need some additional software.

If you installed Google-Cloud-SDK on your computer, then you should know that it provides lots of packages, such as `kubectl`, *as well as* `minikube`! You can install these using gcloud commands:
```
gcloud components list

gcloud components install COMPONENT_ID
```

In case you installed google-cloud-sdk YUM repository, then installing these packages is as simple as `yum install <package-name>` 

```

üí°  You can also use 'minikube kubectl -- get pods' to invoke a matching version
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

At this point, you should see minikube VM running in KVM:

```

### Minikube Addons:
By deafult, Minikube brings several addons with it in the deafult installation, but only few are enabled. Depending on your needs you can enable different addons.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube addons list

[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube addons enable dashboard
üåü  The 'dashboard' addon is enabled
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

To use the dashboard addon, run the `minikube dashboard` command:

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube dashboard
ü§î  Verifying dashboard health ...
üöÄ  Launching proxy ...
ü§î  Verifying proxy health ...
üéâ  Opening http://127.0.0.1:37419/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ in your default browser...
Opening in existing browser session.
```

(At this point a browser window will open in your computer and Kubernetes dashboard will be running visible inside it.)

|  ![images/minikube-dashboard.png](images/minikube-dashboard.png) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |


One more addon that will surely prove useful is the `metrics-server`. It will help you figure out how much CPU and RAM your pods (and node) are consuming.

``` 
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube addons enable metrics-server
üåü  The 'metrics-server' addon is enabled
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
``` 

Nodes - CPU and RAM usage:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl top nodes
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%   
minikube   153m         7%     1193Mi          33%       
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

Pods - CPU and RAM usage:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE              NAME                                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)

Install Helm-Tiller addon, which is good to install helm charts on your minikube cluster:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube addons enable helm-tiller
üåü  The 'helm-tiller' addon is enabled
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```


The plugins you enable will show up as pods in the `kube-system` name-space.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods

## Stopping and starting minikube:

You can stop the VM using:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube stop
‚úã  Stopping "minikube" in kvm2 ...
üõë  Node "m01" stopped.
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

You can start an existing minikube VM by simply running the `minikube start` command. It will pick up all the configuration from files inside `~/.minikube/*` , and bring up the minikube VM in the same state as it was before (including addons). i.e. In such case, it will not create a new minikube VM.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube start
üòÑ  minikube v1.9.2 on Fedora 31
    ‚ñ™ KUBECONFIG=/home/kamran/.kube/config:/home/kamran/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf

‚ùó  /usr/local/bin/kubectl is v1.13.4, which may be incompatible with Kubernetes v1.18.0.
üí°  You can also use 'minikube kubectl -- get pods' to invoke a matching version
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube status

kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured

[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

## Verify host to minikube VM connectivity:

Find the IP of your minikube machine. This is important for understanding, but we will talk about this in a moment.
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube ip
192.168.39.174
```

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ ping 192.168.39.174

For any OS related maintenance (or exploration), log onto the minikube vm directly, using `minikube ssh` command:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube ssh

(Ignore the error message about `/etc/environment`) 


## Setup `/etc/hosts` on host computer:
On the host computer, add an entry for minikube in the `/etc/hosts` file.

```
[root@kworkhorse ~]# head /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1  localhost localhost.localdomain

# minikube VM
192.168.39.174	minikube
[root@kworkhorse ~]#
```


## Use kubectl to interact with kuberntes cluster running in minikube:
Now we have minikube installed. It is time to start using it. We already have kubectl installed on the host computer, and minikube has already created a `kube/config` for us. Minikube also sets the context for kubectl to use minikube cluster. So if we run `kubectl` commands against this cluster, the commands will work. 

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                                                    CLUSTER                                                 AUTHINFO                                                NAMESPACE
          gke_trainingvideos_europe-north1-a_docker-to-k8s-demo   gke_trainingvideos_europe-north1-a_docker-to-k8s-demo   gke_trainingvideos_europe-north1-a_docker-to-k8s-demo   
          kubernetes-admin@kubernetes                             kubernetes                                              kubernetes-admin                                        
*         minikube                                                minikube                                                minikube                                                
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE               KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
minikube   Ready    master   3d22h   v1.18.0   192.168.39.174   <none>        Buildroot 2019.02.10   4.19.107         docker://19.3.8
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

## Create our first deployment on this cluster:
Lets create our first deployment on this cluster, and then access it from our host computer.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:alpine
deployment.apps/nginx created

[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-745b4df97d-wjrtr   1/1     Running   0          14s
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

## Access your application through NodePort:
Lets expose this `deployment` as a service of `type: NodePort`, so we can access it from our host computer. 

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port 80
service/nginx exposed


[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        4d1h
nginx        NodePort    10.98.136.156   <none>        80:31255/TCP   6s
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 

```

Now, we can access this service using our minikube VM's IP address and the NodePort assigned to the service.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ curl 192.168.39.174:31255
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
. . . 
</head>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
</html>
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

Great! So we can access the service using VM's IP and the NodePort of the service.

## Using MiniKube's built in LoadBalancer:
First, lets delete the existing nginx service , and create a new one as `type:LoadBalancer`.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl delete service nginx
service/nginx deleted
```

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port 80
service/nginx exposed


[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        4d21h
nginx        LoadBalancer   10.106.130.70   <pending>     80:32185/TCP   4s
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

Notice that the `EXTERNAL-IP` is in `<pending>` state. 

MiniKube's LoadBalancer is activated when we run `minikube tunnel` command. As soon as the internal loadbalancer comes up, the service gets an EXTERNAL-IP address.

Remember that `minikube tunnel` command needs to run in a separate terminal, and it will ask you sudo password, as it needs to do some `iptables` magic on your work-computer.

Here is what it looks like:
```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ minikube tunnel
[sudo] password for kamran: 
Status:	
	machine: minikube
	pid: 75840
	route: 10.96.0.0/12 -> 192.168.39.174
	minikube: Running
	services: [nginx]
    errors: 
		minikube: no errors
		router: no errors
		loadbalancer emulator: no errors
. . . 
```
(above goes on forever)


Back on the first terminal, if you check the list of services, you will see that your service has an EXTERNAL-IP address - `10.106.130.170`. 


```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl  get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>          443/TCP        5d
nginx        LoadBalancer   10.106.130.70   10.106.130.70   80:32185/TCP   171m
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

You can now access your service as you would normally do through a LoadBalancer IP, without using any fancy ports.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ curl 10.106.130.70
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
. . . 
<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$
```


# Some limitations of minikube:

* The IP address of the minikube VM may change during subsequent `stop` , `start` operations. But if all you want to do is use `kubectl` to access the cluster inside that VM, then you should not be bothered, as the `minikube start` command updates your local `kube/config` file with the latest IP address of the minikube VM/API-server.
* Minikube comes with a built-in ingress/reverse proxy (using nginx), but you still can't use LetsEncrypt's certificates while using their HTTP challenge. That is so, because you will most probably be behind a home router/firewall. If you install Traefik with HTTPS support enabled, but without enabling LetsEncrypt, you can still access your apps over HTTPS using TRAEFIK_DEFAULT_CERT. This certificate will be self signed, but at least you will get HTTPS URLs working. Though you can use LetsEncrypt DNS challenge to get valid certificates for your apps running in your minikube cluster, and have your apps served through HTTPS.
